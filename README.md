## Textile and Mixed-media Artist

**Although I am a textile artist I like the freedom to work in any material and on any scale. This is reflected in my wallhangings which can be a modest 15"x17" or a bold 7'x4.5', space is the only thing preventing me going bigger, at the moment.**

Textile to me is anything that can be hooked, woven or sewn. To this base I add carved and shaped wood, metal and glass.  With these materials I recreate geological features and maritime views. I often work from photographs and this has lead me to look at photography as a new way of expressing myself.

## Saffron Walden Town, an Exhibition

**I’ve lived in Saffron Walden since 1980 and have always been fascinated by the history of the place, along with the love of maps.**

I’ve been playing with the idea of making a textile map but deciding on scale and medium was a sticking point.
In 2017 I asked if I could look at the photocopies of the Saffron Walden maps in the library archives, and wow that blew my mind! 

I knew exactly what needed to be done. So set up with tracing paper and pencils I spent an entire day tracing out the _“Saffron Walden Town plan by Surveyor Edward John Eyre”_ Cira 1757-1758. 

Over the intervening years I’ve worked on this map and a collection of works relating to Saffron Walden. My collection of works covers a wide range of textile techniques including, quilting, tapestry, stump work, locker hook, fabric painting and printing.

I am pleased to invite you to come and view this work at the Library in Saffron Walden.
